## Implementing Neural network for predicting using pre-trained weights
Implementing Neural network for predicting the output without using any higher level python libraries using pre-trained weights
I have used numpy library only to initialize the array and it is eventually converted back to python list.

###### ``` inputs for script```
- ```Input array```
- ```pre-trained weights```
- ``` model-architecture (.csv file)```

#### To run the script : 
```shell
$ python predicting_without_libraries.py
```
###### ``` Layers Implemented```:
- ```Conv1D Layer```
- ```Dense Layer```
- ```Maxpool1D layer``` 

###### ``` Activation Functions ```:
- ```Relu```
- ```Sigmoid```
